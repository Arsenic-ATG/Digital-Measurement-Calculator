# Digital-Measurement-Calculator
This Program can calculate all the measurements, whether you need to calculate 3D shapes or 2D <br />
this is the first time I implemented class and objects in this project.

### Roadmap
in each step I would have refactor the code and do cleanups.
1. have each shape have it's own class (done)
2. handle-invaild-expression (half done)
3. take history of each output produced
3.5: Optimize and Improve UI
4. Use a graphics library like SFML
5. solve equation if any one or two parameters are missing
6. Visibally show the calculation or each step to solve
